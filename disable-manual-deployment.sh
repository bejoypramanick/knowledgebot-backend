## Overview
This project uses **GitHub Actions only** for all deployments. Manual deployment scripts are disabled to ensure consistency, security, and proper CI/CD practices.

## Allowed Deployment Methods

### 1. Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
- **Trigger**: Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- **Process**: GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys
- **Environment**: 
  - `main` branch ‚Üí Production
  - `develop` branch ‚Üí Staging

### 2. Manual Deployment via GitHub Actions
- **Trigger**: Use "workflow_dispatch" in GitHub Actions
- **Process**: 
  1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
  2. Select "Deploy KnowledgeBot Backend" workflow
  3. Click "Run workflow"
  4. Choose environment (staging/production)
  5. Click "Run workflow"

### 3. Emergency Deployment (DevOps Only)
- **When**: Critical production issues requiring immediate fix
- **Process**: 
  1. Contact DevOps team
  2. Temporarily enable manual scripts
  3. Deploy and immediately disable scripts
  4. Document the emergency deployment

## Disabled Methods
- ‚ùå Direct AWS CLI deployment
- ‚ùå Manual Docker builds and pushes
- ‚ùå Local deployment scripts
- ‚ùå Direct Lambda function updates

## Security Benefits
- All deployments are logged and auditable
- Consistent environment across all deployments
- Automated security scanning
- Proper secret management
- Rollback capabilities

## Getting Help
- **GitHub Issues**: Create an issue for deployment problems
- **DevOps Team**: Contact for emergency deployments
- **Documentation**: See README.md for detailed setup instructions
